Movie Recommendation System

This project contains Java files for a movie recommendation system. The program uses 
movie ratings from other users to make weighted recommendations for the current user 
based on input ratings. It does this by scoring other users by how similar their movie 
ratings are to the current users ratings and suggesting movies that those users rated 
highly. The program generates HTML and CSS to be ran and displayed in a browser.

*Disclaimer* 
    This project was carried out as part of a guided project from a Duke University
    online course, 'Java Programming: Build a Recommendation System.' Much of the code
    for the first - fourth ratings and filter classes was guided through lectures, 
    although the lectures were only referenced if I failed to replicate the desired 
    results on my own. The only classes that were included in the final submission to
    Duke's website were RecommendationRunner, FourthRatings, TrueFilter, and 
    YearAfterFilter as anything else was either unused or supplemented by the website.

-How to Run the Program
    Go to https://www.dukelearntoprogram.com/capstone/recommender.php?id=DJ4d6VjO7iWrgC 
    to see the code run. The program does not run on it's own. Duke designed the course
    so that part of their own website would execute the code on it's end to reduce the 
    confusion of using HTML/JS to execute the code as the focus of the course path was 
    primarily Java/object-oriented programming. There is a data folder that has the 
    hard data and small data examples for testing.
